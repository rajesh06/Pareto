\section{Introduction}
In one of his seminal works, Stephen W. Philbrick\cite{Philbrick} proposed an elegant solution to the complex problem of modeling claims amounts in excess layers. That solution involved the use a Pareto Type I distribution for claims above an excess threshold.\\

This paper expands on that work in several ways through the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A consitent notational framework
\item A review of the various formulae including supporting derivation in the Appendices
\item Consideration of maximum probably loss using order statistics
\item Quatification of parameter uncertainty using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (expanding on the work of Meyers and Reichle \& Yonkunis)
\item Frequency and severity trends
\item Dealing with claims less than the threshold (expaning on the work of Fackler)
\end{enumerate}
